# Small-3D-Engine
This is a small 3D engine built for a computer graphics cours at Laval University. It uses [openframeworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks) for setting up the rendering context and the basic rendering loop. Everything else (shaders, geometry, lighting, model loading) was coded by our team.
